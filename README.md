# Welcome to your Lovable project

### Six Harmony Combinations (六合) and Their Attributes:
```
Mao and Xu (卯戌相合): This combination symbolises a barren mountain transformed by greenery, with individuals representing respect, diplomacy, and harmony in relationships. This combination produces Fire, due to the interaction between Wu Earth (戊土) and Yi Wood (乙木).
Chen and You (辰酉合): Symbolised by a tall mountain crowned with treasure, this combination represents power and authority but may also signal potential conflicts. Due to the interactions between Wu Earth and Xin Metal (辛金), this combination produces Earth.
Zi and Chou (子丑合): Earth provides a stable foundation, while Gui Water, symbolised as a cloud, adds intuition and intelligence to complement weaknesses. Through the interplay of Ji Earth and Gui Water, this combination produces Earth, representing stability, security, trustworthiness, and confidence.
Yin and Hai (寅亥合): Just as water nourishes nature, the interaction between Ren Water and Jia Wood produces Wood, fostering wisdom and progression. The Tiger-Pig Harmony combination signifies growth, improvement, productivity, and discovery.
Si and Shen (巳申合): Likened to metal melting into a liquid state when exposed to great heat, this combination produces Water. The Snake-Monkey combination is often related to attributes of wisdom, intelligence, honour and productivity garnered from interacting with other individuals.
Wu and Wei (午未合): Symbolised by fire erupting from the earth, this combination produces Fire, representing transformation and unlocking hidden talents and previously untapped resources. It is associated with literary pursuits, entrepreneurial skills, foresight, and strong communication abilities.
```
### Six Clashes and Their Attributes:
```
Chen and Xu (辰戌相冲): Aligned with Wu Earth, this clash signifies conflicts over responsibilities, dominance, or indecision, often leading to power struggles. It may manifest as excessive ambition or quick temper, potentially resulting in unwise investments or a shortened lifespan.
Si and Hai (巳亥相冲): Linked to hidden conflicts and misunderstandings, this clash may involve unspoken resentments, unintended offences, or unneeded assistance.
Yin and Shen (寅申相冲): Represent personality clashes and differing life approaches, leading to emotional turmoil, misunderstandings, and interpersonal conflict.
Mao and You (卯酉相冲): The Rabbit and Rooster clash involves disputes over details or methods, resulting in friction, betrayal, or sharp criticism in accomplishing tasks or achieving goals.
Zi and Wu (子午相冲): This clash can be summarised as a conflict between logic and emotions, with an individual’s thoughts being at odds with their emotions regarding a specific situation. This may manifest in internal unease and turbulence in decision-making.
Chou and Wei (丑未相冲): Signifying inflexibility and stagnation, this indicates conflicts due to differing approaches to life, which can result in conflicts and misunderstandings. This clash leads to obstacles, stubbornness, and conflict in progressing toward goals.
```
### Six Harms and Their Effects:
```
Mao and Chen (卯辰相害): Individuals may struggle with self-doubt, fearing they cannot meet expectations, and may lead to difficulties interacting with others. Additionally, they may struggle with the constant fear of being taken advantage of, perpetually wary of even their closest companions.
You and Xu (酉戌相害): Those in this pairing often face low self-esteem, harbouring a constant worry about the future. They may be prone to injuries concerning the back, face, or head. They may also experience challenges in maintaining stable relationships, including a higher risk of divorce.
Shen and Hai (申亥相害): This pairing signifies a fear of commitment and misplaced priorities. Individuals may avoid accepting help or fear harming others, requiring caution in communication to prevent conflicts and maintain harmony.
Chou and Wu (丑午相害): The Ox-Horse Six Harm combination causes self-worth issues, with individuals feeling undervalued and reluctant to fully engage with peers. Their lack of understanding in relationships can lead to strained connections and personal dissatisfaction.
Zi and Wei (子未相害): The Rat-Goat Six Harm combination leads to clouded judgment, exaggeration of problems, and aversion to risks. This pairing tends to assume worst-case scenarios, inhibiting growth and independence.
Yin and Si (寅巳相害): Associated with distrust of others and scepticism towards positive experiences, this harm may result in misjudged interactions. Dominance of this combination in a chart can indicate heightened accident risks, requiring careful mitigation.
