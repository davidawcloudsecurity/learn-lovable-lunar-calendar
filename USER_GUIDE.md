# 📅 Your Personal Pattern Calendar – Beginner's Guide

Welcome! This app helps you spot patterns in your "good days" vs "bad days" using a 5,000-year-old system called BaZi (Chinese astrology). Don't worry - you don't need to understand the theory to benefit from it.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (First 5 Minutes)

### What You'll See First

When you open the app, you'll see a **monthly calendar** with:
- Regular dates (1, 2, 3...)
- Chinese characters next to each date
- **Colored backgrounds** behind some characters (🟢 Green, 🟡 Yellow, 🔴 Red)

### What It Means

Think of this like a **weather forecast for your decisions**:
- 🟢 **Green days** = Clear skies (good for important stuff)
- 🟡 **Yellow days** = Partly cloudy (proceed with caution)
- 🔴 **Red days** = Storm warning (maybe wait on big decisions)

### Your First Action

**Just track what happens.** Tap any day and log:
- How you felt
- Any important decisions you made
- What went well or poorly

That's it. The app will start spotting patterns for you.

## 📊 Understanding Your Calendar

### The Color Code (Risk Levels)

| Color | What It Means | What To Do |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| 🟢 **Green (Low Risk)** | Your energy aligns well with today | ✅ Great for: starting projects, important meetings, signing contracts, launching products |
| 🟡 **Yellow (Medium Risk)** | Neutral energy, minor friction possible | ⚠️ Okay for: routine work, small decisions, planning |
| 🔴 **Red (High Risk)** | Energy clash with your personal chart | ⏸️ Avoid: major commitments, confrontations, big purchases. Good for: reflection, research, rest |

**Real Example:**
- Green day: "Pitched to investor, they said yes!" ✅
- Red day: "Same pitch, they seemed annoyed" ❌

### The Chinese Characters (Your Daily "Energy Signature")

Each day has two characters, like **甲子** or **丙午**.

**Think of them like:**
- Your daily "weather pattern"
- A unique energy combination
- Your personal horoscope for that day

**You don't need to memorize them.** The app calculates how they interact with YOUR birth chart and shows you the color-coded result.

## 🎯 How to Use This App (Week by Week)

### Week 1: Just Track

**Goal:** Build the habit of checking in daily

**What to do:**
1. Open the app each morning
2. Check today's color
3. At end of day, tap the date and log:
   - 👍 Good day / 👎 Rough day / 😐 Meh
   - One sentence about what happened

**Don't worry about:** Understanding the Chinese characters, BaZi theory, or why days are colored certain ways.

### Week 2-4: Notice Patterns

**Goal:** Start seeing correlations

**What to look for:**
- Do you feel more anxious on red days?
- Do green days tend to go smoother?
- Are there patterns in your mood/energy?

**The app will help:** After 2 weeks, check your notes. You'll likely see patterns like:
- "I had 3 bad meetings - all on red days"
- "My best work happened on green days"

### Month 2: Learn the Basics

**Now you're ready to understand WHY**

The app will start explaining:
- What "Clash" means (energy conflict)
- What "Harmony" means (energy support)
- How your birth chart creates your personal pattern

**Progressive learning:** The Horse mascot will pop up with bite-sized explanations based on what you're experiencing.

## 🧭 Key Features Explained

### 1. Monthly Calendar View

**What you see:**
- Current month grid (Sun-Sat)
- Today is highlighted
- Each day shows:
  - Date number (1, 2, 3...)
  - Chinese characters (energy signature)
  - Colored background (risk level)
  - Small dot = you logged notes that day

**How to use it:**
- Tap any day to log what happened
- Right-click (or long-press) for more options:
  - View hourly details
  - Log behavior pattern

### 2. Daily Risk Levels (The Most Important Part!)

**This is calculated based on:**
- Your personal birth chart (entered during setup)
- Today's energy signature
- How they interact (clash, harmony, neutral)

**Why it matters:**
Research shows people make better decisions when they're aware of their energy patterns. This gives you that awareness.

**Example:**
If your Day Pillar is "Horse" (午) and today is "Rat" (子), that's a **Clash** = 🔴 Red day. Historically, people report more conflicts and regrets on clash days.

### 3. Solar Terms (Seasonal Markers)

Below the calendar, you'll see dates like:
- **Feb 4 — Start of Spring (立春)**
- **Feb 19 — Rain Water (雨水)**

**What they are:** 24 seasonal markers used in Chinese calendar for 3,000+ years

**Why they matter:** 
- Mark energy shifts in nature
- Traditional timing for planting, business cycles, health practices
- Some people feel energy changes around these dates

**How to use them:** Just be aware. Notice if you feel different around these transitions.

### 4. BaZi Pillars (Bottom of Screen)

You'll see something like:
```
丙午 Y
庚寅 M
癸亥 D
```

**What they are:**
- **Y** = Year Pillar (your generation's energy)
- **M** = Month Pillar (current season's energy)
- **D** = Day Pillar (today's specific energy)

**For beginners:** Just ignore these for now. They're for advanced users who want to do deeper analysis.

**When you're ready:** These show the "stem-branch" combinations that create your daily forecast. The app already interprets them for you (that's the color coding).

## 💡 Tips for Beginners

### Do's ✅

1. **Check your color each morning** - Takes 5 seconds
2. **Log at least 3-4 days per week** - Enough to spot patterns
3. **Trust your experience** - If you feel great on a "red day," that's valid data

5. **Use it as a guide, not a rule** - You still have free will!

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't panic on red days** - They're just "be extra careful" days
2. **Don't skip green days** - They're your high-performance windows
3. **Don't try to learn all the theory** - Let the app do the work
4. **Don't expect perfection** - This is about improving odds, not guarantees
5. **Don't ignore your gut** - Combine this with your intuition

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"All my days are yellow/neutral"**
→ Set up your personal BaZi profile in settings. Without it, the app can't calculate personalized risk levels.

**"I had a great day on a red day"**
→ Perfect! That's valuable data. Red days aren't "bad" - they're just "be aware." You navigated it well.

**"I don't see any patterns yet"**
→ Keep tracking. Patterns typically emerge around day 30. You need enough data points.

**"The Chinese characters are confusing"**
→ You can ignore them! Just focus on the colors. The characters are for advanced users.

**"I forgot to log for a week"**
→ No worries. Just start again. Even inconsistent tracking reveals patterns over time.
